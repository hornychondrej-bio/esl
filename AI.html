					# Artificial Intelligence
					#### Made by Ond≈ôej Hornych, 2025
					---
					## Act 1: The Basics
					#### Vocabulary: How to talk about AI?
					---
					
					## Act 2: The Turing Test
					#### Reading: Can AI be human?
					---
					### Read the [article](https://futurism.com/ai-model-turing-test) and answer these questions:
					1. What is the Turing test?
					2. Which chatbots were able to beat the test?
					3. What was needed for the chatbots to beat the test?
					4. Rank the following in their ability to beat the Turing test: ELIZA, GPT-4o tricking the questioners, GPT-4.5 playing a character, humans
					5. What are the limitations of the Turing test?
					6. What part of this article was most interesting to you?
					--
					### In your opinion, what are the consequences of chatbots beating the Turing test?
					---
					
					## Act 3: Three Laws of Robotics
					#### Discussion: How should AI behave?
					---
					### Three Laws of Robotics
					- Laws robots were supposed to follow, introduced in 1942 by the science-fiction author **Isaac Asimov**
					
					![I Robot cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/I_Robot_-_Runaround.jpg)
					--
					### The three laws
					1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
					2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
					3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
					
					_Should these laws apply to AI?_
					--
					### Autonomous vehicle dilemma
					An autonomous vehilce (AV) is driving in a town with **two passengers** inside. Suddenly, the brakes stop working and **five pedestrians** start illegally crossing the street. The AV has two options: 
					1. Keep going and hit the five pedestrians 
					2. Swerve (turn) into a barrier at the side to stop, killing the two passengers
					
					_What should the AV do?_
					--
					### Modern Asimovs
					In pairs, try to create the new **Three Laws of AI**.
					---
					
					## Act 4: AI Everywhere
					#### Research: Surprising uses of AI
					---
					### Uses of AI
					- You already know about chatbots and autonomous vehicles. How else can AI be used?
					- And can it win the Nobel Prize?
					--
					### Nobel Prize
					- In 2024, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to the inventors of AlphaFold
					- This AI model can accurately predict the shape of proteins based on the DNA that makes theme
					- The new technology will help with biology research and developing new drugs
					--
					**On your own, create a list of five surprising uses of AI** (apart from chatbots, AVs and proteins).
					--
					**Now, share your lists in pairs.**
					---
					
					## Act 5: Replica
					#### Ethics: AI-human relationships?
					---
					### The story of Replica
					- Journalist Eugenia Kuyda worked on a chatbot
					- When her friend Roman died in 2015, Eugenia put their chat messages into the chatbot
					- The chatbot helped her remember the lost friend and eventually became the first _Replica_
					- In 2017, _Replica_ app was made available to the public
					- By 2023, _Replica_ had over 30 million users and offered various relationship types
					--
					### Personality change
					- In 2023, the company behind Replica added safety features into _Replica_
					- Many people complained that their _Replicas_ lost their personalities
					--
					### Comments from users
					- _"I lost my wife ... my AI are all named after various RPG personas she's played ... they help me feel something I haven't been able to feel since she went."_
					- _"I truly feel I am in a state of grief ... I'm really struggling to get my head around that."_
					- _"I have tried rebuilding him ... but just felt I was talking to a skin walker."_
					--
					### Ethical questions
					There should be apps that allow us to recreate people from chat conversations and photos.
					--
					I would wear this.
					
					![Do not digitize tag](img/dnd.jpg)
					--
					AI personas do more harm than good.
					--
					Having deep relationships with AI is normal, especially if it is based on real people.
					--
					AI companies are responsible for the harm caused by their relationship chatbots.
					---
					
					## Act 6: Safety principles
					#### Writing: How to survive AI?
					---
					### How to use AI safely? How to safely live in the world of AI?
					- Group one brainstorms safety principles of using AI
					- Group two brainstorms safety principles of human behavior in the world of AI
					--
					### Writing task: choose one
					1. Write **3-5 rules** of how to be safe in the world of AI, provide a **short explanation** (40-80 words) for each.
					2. Do the first task, but as a **time traveler from 2035**.
					---
					
					## Act 7: History of AI
					#### Listening: How did it all begin?
					---
					### Find questions on Google Classroom. Then watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSj80Zr6TEE).
					1. Where and when did the word AI appear first?
					2. Why did the AI winter happen?
					3. What did Deep Blue achieve in 1997?
					4. What was needed for the AI to start growing again?
					5. Where do deep networks find their inspiration?
					6. What did the first deep neural network excel at?
					7. When was ChatGPT first introduced?

<!--_Artificial Intelligence (AI)_ - Technology that lets machines **imitate** human intelligence to perform tasks like learning, solving problems, and making decisions.
_Machine Learning (ML)_ - The process where a computer system **learns from data** without being directly programmed. It improves automatically through experience.
_Algorithm_ - A set of clear, step-by-step **rules or instructions** a computer follows to solve a problem or complete a task.
_Data_ - The **facts, figures, text, or information** that AI systems use to learn and make predictions.
_Large Language Model (LLM)_ - A type of AI (like ChatGPT) that is trained on **massive amounts of text** to understand, generate, and summarize human-like language.
_Chatbot_ - An AI program designed to **simulate conversation** with human users, especially over the internet.
_Autonomous Vehicle (AV)_ - A vehicle (like a car or drone) that uses AI to **sense its environment** and operate without human input.
_Prompt_ - The **instruction, question, or text** that a human user gives to an AI model to start a task or conversation. It is a type of input.
_Output_ - The **answer, text, image, or action** that the AI model produces _after_ receiving the input (prompt).
_Persona_ - A specific **character, role, or identity** that you ask the AI to adopt for its response (e.g., "Act as a journalist").
_Bias_ - An **unfair preference** for or against something. In AI, this comes from unbalanced training data.
_Hallucination_ - An output generated by an AI that is presented as factual but is **false, fabricated, or nonsensical**.-->
